# ILCBooker
My university has a site where an engineering student can book a study room. However, each student can only book 4 rooms at a time, meaning that sometimes you run out of rooms.
By using a security flaw that I noticed in the software the school used (which I have reported to the IT department) I was able to book as many rooms as I wanted for as long as I wanted, so I would never run out of them.

# Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Uncomment the commented section (this does the actual booking)
3. Place your student credentials at the top of the application

# Dependencies
[Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/) - Library used for testing web applications, but also allows to emulate user clicks and filling input fields.
